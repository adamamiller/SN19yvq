\section{Discovery and Observations}\label{sec:obs}

\sn\ was discovered by K.~Itagaki, and detected at an unfiltered magnitude of
16.7\,mag, in an image obtained on 2019 Dec 28.74 UT\footnote{UT times are
used throughout this paper}. The transient candidate was announced
$\sim$2\,hr later on the Transient Name Server (TNS), and given the
designation AT\,2019yvq \citep{Itagaki19}. Susequent spectroscopic
observations confirmed the SN nature of the transient, with initial reports
that the event was a SN Ib/c \citep{Kawabata20}, but later reports classified
the event as a SN Ia \todo{create refs for Prentice obs}. These spectroscopic
observations also showed \sn\ to be at the same redshift as NGC\,4441, its
host galaxy.

\subsection{ZTF Photometric Observations}

ZTF simulataneously conducts multiple time-domain surveys using the ZTF
camera on the the Palomar Oschin Schmidt 48 inch (P48) telescope. \sn\ was
first detected by ZTF on 2019 Dec 29.46, as part of the ZTF public survey
(see \citealt{Bellm19a}). The automated ZTF pipeline \citep{Masci19}
automatically detected \sn, which passed internal thresholds (e.g.,
\citealt{Mahabal19}), leading to the production and disemination of a
real-time alert \citep{Patterson19}. The public alert included the position,
$\alpha = 12^{\mathrm{h}}27\arcmin21\farcs836$, $\delta =
+64\degr47\arcmin59\farcs87$ (J2000), and brightness, \rztf$ =
17.14\pm0.05$\,mag, which, together with the \citet{Itagaki19} discovery
report suggested the SN was fading. Continued monitoring with ZTF, and
follow-up with other telescopes, confirmed a spectacular decline in the early
emission from \sn\ (Figure~\ref{fig:p48}).

    epochs of spectroscopic observations. \todo{add marks for dates of

    %
    \label{fig:p48}
\end{figure}

The field of \sn\ was additionally observed by ZTF with nearly a nightly
cadence as part of the ZTF partnership Uniform Depth Survey (ZUDS;
D.~Goldstein et al., in prep.). Using images obtained as part of the ZUDS
program, we perform forced PSF photometry at the location of \sn\ following
the procedure described in \citet{Yao19}.\footnote{Images obtained as part of
the ZTF public survey have not been released, preventing us from applying our
forced-PSF measurements. We therefore only include forced-PSF measurements in
the analysis described herein, though we note that our measurements are
largely consistent with those provided in the public alerts.} The evolution
of \sn\ in the \gztf, \rztf, and \iztf\ filters is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:p48}.

\subsection{Other Photometric Observations}

Ultraviolet (UV) observations of \sn\ were obtained with the
Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT; \citet{Roming05}) onboard the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory (hereafter \textit{Swift}; \citealt{Gehrels04})
following a time-of-opportunity request by D.~Hiramatsu. Pre-SN UVOT
reference images are limited to the $uvw1$, $uvm2$, and $uvw2$ filters. We
estimate the flux in these filters using an aperture of size PPP pixels at
the SN position, and subtract the flux measured using an identical procedure
in the pre-SN images\todo{Steve add additional details}. For clarity, we only
show the \textit{Swift} $uvw1$ and $uvm2$ light curves in
Figure~\ref{fig:p48} (the $uvw2$ evolution is nearly identical to $uvm2$).
\textit{Swift}/UVOT observations show that the initial decline seen in the
optical is even more dramatic in the UV.

While we exclude flux measurements in the UVOT $u$, $b$, and $v$ filters in
our analysis below, we can nevertheless estimate the time of $B$-band maximum
\tbmax\ from the host-contaminated $b$-band light curve given that the host
flux provides a constant offset at all epochs. Using a second-order
polynomial, we model the $b$-band light curve near peak (including
observations between JD$\,> \,$2,458,855.5 and JD$\,<\,$2,458,871.5). From
this fit we estimate \tbmax$ = $2,458,863.83$ \,\pm \,0.21$\,JD.

\todo{add paragraph about X-ray limits}

\subsection{Optical Spectroscopy}

Spectroscopic observations of \sn\ were taken with a variety of telescopes
and instruments over multiple epochs beginning $\sim$3\,d after discovery and
continuing through $\sim$7\,wk after \tbmax \todo{update these numbers}. An
observing log is listed in Table~\ref{tab:spectra}. The spectra were reduced
using standard procedures in \texttt{IDL}/\texttt{Python}/\texttt{Matlab}.
The optical spectral evolution of \sn\ is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:spec_evo}.

\section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

\subsection{NGC\,4441: the Host of \sn}\label{sec:host}

NGC\,4441 is the host galaxy of \sn. SDSS spectroscopic measurements of the
nucleus of NGC\,4441 yield a heliocentric-recession velocity of 2663\,\kms\
($z_\mathrm{helio} = 0.00888$; \citealt{Abolfathi18}) and a \texttt{STARBURST}
classification for NGC\,4441. Using the 2M++ model of \citet{Carrick15}, we
estimate a peculiar velocity towards NGC\,4441 of $+328.6$\,\kms, which
combined with the recession velocity in the frame of the cosmic microwave
background\footnote{See
\url{https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/velocity_calculator}} (CMB, $v_\mathrm{CMB}
= 2770$\,\kms), yields a total recession velocity $\approx 3100$\,\kms. We
note that this estimate is consistent, to within $\sim$5\%, with the Virgo and
Great Attractor infall models of \citet{Mould00}. Adopting $H_0 =
73$\,\kms\,Mpc$^{-1}$, we estimate the distance to NGC\,4441 to be 42.5\,Mpc,
corresponding to a distance modulus of $\mu = 33.14 \pm 0.15$\,mag, where the
uncertainty on $\mu$ is dominated by the uncertainty in the peculiar velocity
correction. We hereafter adopt 33.14\,mag as the distance modulus to
NGC\,4441.\footnote{\citet{Tonry01} estimate a significantly smaller distance
to NGC\,4441 ($\mu = 31.40 \pm 0.45$\,mag; $D = 19.0$\,Mpc) based on surface
brightness fluctuations (SBF). We do not adopt this estimate as SBF
measurements are better suited to relative distance measurements.} \todo{Lots
of differrent catalogs provide metallicity for SDSS galaxies, should we report
on these results at all? Port Z = 0.04 and Granada Z ~0.01, and do not agree,
firefly ~ 0.6 0r 0.2 (solar?) depending on weighting, probably not a great
idea}


We estimate the total redenning towards \sn\ to be small. There is relatively 
little line of sight extinction due to the Milky Way, $E(B-V) \approx
0.018$\,mag \citep{Schlafly11}. Furthermore, we do not find significant
evidence for strong extinction in NGC\,4441. Figure~\ref{fig:NaD} highlights
the \ion{Na}{I} D absorption in the spectrum of \sn\ due to gas in NGC\,4441
and the Milky Way from our highest-resolution spectrum, obtained with the
1000 lines/mm grating on Binospec+MMT. The \ion{Na}{I} D absorption is weak,
and we estimate a total equivalent width (EW) $= 390$\,m\AA\ for NGC\,4441
and $220$\,m\AA\ for the Milky Way. There is a systematic uncertainty of
$\sim$10\% on each of these estimates due to uncertainties in the
continuum-fitting procedure. Assuming similar properties for the dust in
NGC\,4441 and the Milky Way, we scale the color excess measurement for the
Milky Way by the ratio of \ion{Na}{I} D EWs to estimate $E(B-V) \approx
0.032$\,mag for \sn\ due to absorption in NGC\,4441. This yields a total
color excess towards \sn\ of $E(B-V) \approx 0.05$\,mag, which we adopt for
the subsequent analysis in this study. We note that this estimate is
consistent, to within the uncertainties, with the EW(\ion{Na}{I} D)--$E(B-V)$
relations presented in \citet{Poznanski12}.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=3.4in]{./figures/NaD.pdf}

    velocity scale is centered on the D$_2$ line in NGC\,4441, with the SDSS
    redshift shown via the vertical dashed line. No shift has been applied to
    the Milky Way lines. The \ion{Na}{I} D lines, which serve as a proxy for
    dust-obscuration along the line of sight (e.g.,
    \citealt{Poznanski12,Phillips13}) are weak, indicating a relatively small
    amount of reddening.}
    %
    \label{fig:NaD}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Photometric Analysis}

We estimate the time of first light, \tfl, for \sn\ following the procedure
described in \citet{Miller20}. Briefly, \citet{Miller20} model the early
emission from a SN Ia as a power-law in time, $f \propto (t -
t_\mathrm{fl})^\alpha$, where $f$ is the flux, $t$ is time, and $\alpha$ is
the power-law index. \tfl\ is assumed to be the same everywhere in the
optical, allowing us to simultaneously fit observations in each of the ZTF
filters.

An important caveat for \sn\ is that the observed early decline in the light
curve clearly does not follow the simple power-law model, and thus these
observations must be masked when performing the fit. We conservatively
exclude observations from the first two nights of ZTF detection from the fit
(this choice is conservative as it is unclear when the mechanism that powers
the initial bump in \sn\ no longer significantly contributes to the flux in
the \gztf\ and \rztf\ filters). From the fit we find \tfl$ = -17.5
\pm^{1.0}_{1.3}$\,d relative to \tbmax. We know that the time of explosion
must be $< -17.4$\,d based on the discovery detection in \citealt{Itagaki19},
and, by definition $t_\mathrm{fl} \ge t_\mathrm{exp}$, meaning a portion of
the posterior distribution for our model cannot be correct. We also find
$\alpha_g = 2.15 \pm^{0.49}_{0.36}$ and $\alpha_g = 1.91 \pm^{0.42}_{0.31}$.
These values are typical of the normal SNe Ia studied in \citet{Miller20}. If
we only exclude the first observation from the model fit we find
significantly different results with a rise time that increases by $\sim$5\,d
and power-law indicies that increase by $\gtrsim$1.

While the rise time and power-law indicies of \sn\ are similar to other
normal SNe Ia, the photometric evolution does not resemble normal SNe Ia.
\sn\ is underluminous ($M_{g,\mathrm{max}} \approx -18.5$\,mag), declines
rapidly ($\Delta m_{15}(g) \approx 1.4$\,mag \todo{measure precisely and
provide uncertainties}, and does not exhibit a ``shoulder'' in the \rztf\ or
secondary maximum in the \iztf\ light curves post-maximum. For context, of
the 127 SNe found by ZTF and studied in \citet{Yao19}, only 1, ZTF18abclfee
(SN\,2018crl), a SN\,2002cx-like event, had a faster decline than \sn. The
underluminous, fast-declining evolution of \sn\ is broadly consistent with
the SN\,1991bg-like subclass of SNe Ia (e.g., \citealt{Taubenberger17}),
however, we show that \sn\ is spectroscopically distinct relative to
91bg-like SNe (\S\ref{sec:spec}). We also find that standard SN Ia fitting
techniques, including \texttt{SALT2} \citep{Guy07} and \texttt{SNooPY}
\citep{Burns11}, do not provide good matches to the evolution of \sn.

\sn\ is further distinguished from normal SNe Ia by its unusual color
evolution (Figure~\ref{fig:colors}). The top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:colors}
shows the \gztf$ - $\rztf\ evolution of 35 normal SNe Ia with ZTF
observations within 3\,d of \tfl\ (see \citealt{Bulla20}), with the color
evolution of \sn\ over-plotted. \sn\ exhibits a prominent blue to red to
blue, or ``red bump,'' evolution in the $\sim$week after \tfl. Similar red
bumps are only seen in $\sim$10\% of the ZTF sample \citep{Bulla20}.
Furthermore, while normal SNe Ia exhibit a large scatter in \gztf$ - $\rztf\
shortly after \tfl\ they evolve to form a tight locus around \tbmax. \sn\ is
redder at peak than each of the normal SNe Ia in the \citet{Bulla20} sample,
and it exhibits a far more rapid decline in \gztf$ - $\rztf. In the
$\sim$20\,d after \tbmax, the \gztf$ - $\rztf\ color of \sn\ increases by
$\sim$1.1\,mag, whereas the typical normal SN Ia color only becomes
$\sim$0.5\,mag redder over the same time frame. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3.5in]{./figures/P48_colors.pdf}
    %
    \caption{Photometric color evolution of \sn. \textit{Top}: \gztf$ -
    $\rztf\ evolution of \sn\ (solid green squares), corrected for the total
    line of sight extinction (see \S\ref{sec:host}), and compared with the
    evolution of 35 normal SNe Ia (open circles) observed within 3\,d of
    \tfl\ by ZTF (from \citealt{Bulla20}). \sn\ is the reddest SN in the
    group, and it exhibits the fastest evolution to red colors post-\tbmax.
    \textit{Bottom}: the $uvm2 - uvw1$ (purple crosses), \gztf$ - $\rztf\
    (solid, green squares), and \rztf$ - $\iztf\ (open, red squares) color
    evolution of \sn. The ``red bump'' can clearly be seen in the
    optical.}
    %
    \label{fig:colors}
\end{figure}

The offset in the \gztf$ - $\rztf\ color evolution of \sn\ relative to normal
SNe\,Ia would be reduced if the reddenning towards \sn\ has been significantly
underestimated. A color excess of $E(B-V) \approx 0.25$\,mag, rather than the
0.05\,mag adopted in \S\ref{sec:host}, would roughly align the pre-\tbmax\
\gztf$ - $\rztf\ color of \sn\ with the tight locus seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:colors}. Such a correction would also bring the peak optical
brightness of \sn\ in line with normal SNe\,Ia ($M_g \approx -19.25$\,mag and
$M_r \approx -19.1$\,mag). Such a large reddening would dramatically change
the appearance of \sn\ in the UV. The bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:colors}
shows the $uvm2 - uvw1$ color evolution of \sn. At \tbmax, $uvm2 - uvw1
\approx 1.2$\,mag, which would make it one of the most UV blue SNe\,Ia at
maximum light (e.g., \citealt{Milne10,Brown17}). A color excess of $E(B-V)
\approx 0.25$\,mag would result in $uvm2 - uvw1 \approx 0.7$\,mag at \tbmax,
making \sn\ the most UV blue SN\,Ia observed by \textit{Swift}. Furthermore,
this much extinction would dramatically increase the luminosity of the initial
peak in emission by a factor of $\sim$5. We conservatively estimate the
luminosity $\sim$1.2\,d after \tfl\ to be $\sim$2$\times
10^{42}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. It is difficult to explain such a large luminosity
(see below), increasing this by a factor of 5 and bringing it inline with the
typical peak luminosity of SNe\,Ia, would be nearly impossible to explain. We
therefore conclude that the color excess towards \sn\ is not underestimated,
and that the SN is instead intrinsically red in the optical.

Even if one ignores the striking initial bump in the light curve of \sn, we
can still conclude that \sn\ is not a normal SN Ia based on its other
photometric properties (e.g., low luminosity, fast decline, lack of a
near-infrared secondary maximum, red appearance at peak, and rapid evolution
to red colors after \tbmax).



\subsection{Spectral Evolution}\label{sec:spec}

Our initial spectra of \sn\ are dominated by intermediate mass elements
(IMEs), primarily Si, Ca, and O, moving at extremely high velocities ($>
20,000$\,\kms), as identified in Figure~\ref{fig:spec_evo}. In the spectra
obtained $>$10\,d prior to \tbmax, there is also a strong absorption feature
around 4200\,\AA\ that we tentatively identify as \ion{Mg}{II} $\lambda$ 4481.
Though it is also possible that this feature corresponds to the Ti trough
described in \citet{Polin19} for double-detonation SNe Ia. \todo{Could this
feature be \ion{Si}{3}? could explain small notch at ~4500 Ang} While the
early spectra are dominated by IMEs, we find no evidence for \ion{C}{II}
absorption in the spectra of \sn.

Another interesting feature of the early spectra is the relative prominence of
\ion{Si}{II} $\lambda$5972 relative to \ion{Si}{II} $\lambda$6355. Prominent
\ion{Si}{II} $\lambda$5972 absorption suggests a relatively cool photosphere,
however, by the time of maximum light this feature has almost disappeared
entirely. In our maximum-light spectrum of \sn, we estimate pseudo-equivalent
widths (pEWs) of $183\pm1$\,\AA, and $13\pm2$\,\AA\ for \ion{Si}{II}
$\lambda$6355 and $\lambda$5972, respectively. These pEW measurements
unambiguously classify \sn\ as a broad-line SN Ia according to the
classification scheme presented in \citet{Branch06}. The high velocities
typically associated with this class also match the early evolution of \sn.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3.5in]{./figures/vel_evolution.pdf}

    \caption{Velocity evolution of \ion{Si}{II} $\lambda$6355\,\AA\

    the measurements for 264 SNe Ia observed by the Palomar Transient Factory
    (PTF) as open circles, with PTF\,10ygu, the SN with the fastest moving
    ejecta in the PTF sample, highlighted via orange crosses. We additionally
    show the velocity evolution of SN\,2002bo, a SN that is very similar to
    \sn, as open diamonds. The median velocity evolution of each of the

The velocity evolution of the \ion{Si}{II} $\lambda$6355 absorption feature
in \sn\ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vel_evo}. These measurements have been
made following the procedure described in \citet{Maguire14} (see their
\S2.5). For comparison, we also show the \citet{Maguire14} measurements of
the \ion{Si}{II} velocity evolution of 264 SNe Ia observed by the Palomar
Transient Factory (PTF) as open circles in Figure~\ref{fig:vel_evo}, as well
as the median velocity evolution of SNe belonging to the four different
classes (Shallow Silicon, Core Normal, Broad Line, and Cool) identified in
\citet{Branch06}.\footnote{The velocity measurements are from
\citet{Blondin12}, while the method to determine the median velocity is
described in \citet{Miller18}.} \sn\ stands out among other SNe Ia with
some of the highest \ion{Si}{II} velocities that have ever been observed.
Within the PTF sample, only PTF\,10ygu exhibits a \ion{Si}{II} absorption
velocity as high as \sn\ at every phase in its evolution. \todo{discuss other
BL with fast Si: sn1997bq , sn2002cd, sn2003W?}

\citet{Benetti04} argue that \ion{S}{II} $\lambda$5640\,\AA, as a weak line,
is more likely to be formed close to the continuum photosphere, and therefore
serves as a better tracer of the photospheric velocity than \ion{Si}{II}
$\lambda$6355\,\AA. We measured the absorption velocity of this line using
the same method described above, and find that the \ion{S}{II} absorption
velocity is remarkably $\sim$3000\,\kms\ slower than \ion{Si}{II}
$\lambda$6355\,\AA\ at all epochs where both features are measurable (from
-12\,d to +0\,d relative to \tbmax). \todo{cut this paragraph?}

In Figure~\ref{fig:r_evo} we show the ratio of the pEW for \ion{Si}{II}
$\lambda$5972\,\AA\ to \ion{Si}{II} $\lambda$6355\,\AA\ [$\equiv
\mathcal{R}($\ion{Si}{II}$)$; see \citealt{Hachinger08} for the updated
definition relative to \citealt{Nugent95}] as a function of time. As first
noted by \citet{Nugent95}, and later confirmed by \citet{Hachinger08},
$\mathcal{R}($\ion{Si}{II}$)$ is a luminosity indicator, with larger values of
$\mathcal{R}($\ion{Si}{II}$)$ corresponding to lower luminosities. 

Shortly after explosion, \sn\ exhibits large values of
$\mathcal{R}($\ion{Si}{II}$)$, yet, by maximum light
$\mathcal{R}($\ion{Si}{II}$)$ declines to low values. Compared to the PTF
spectroscopic sample (\citealt{Maguire14}; open circles in
Figure~\ref{fig:r_evo}), \sn\ has one of the largest values of
$\mathcal{R}($\ion{Si}{II}$)$ after explosion before evoloving to have one of
the lowest values around \tbmax. Qualitatively, this behavior is similar to
SN\,2002bo (open diamonds in Figure~\ref{fig:r_evo}). Such evolution is
atypical, for reference the normal SN\,2011fe is also highlighted in
Figure~\ref{fig:r_evo} (open squares). At face value, the
$\mathcal{R}($\ion{Si}{II}$)$ evolution suggests that the effective
temperature of \sn\ increases significantly as it rises to maximum light. The
optical colors (see Figure~\ref{fig:colors}), however, are nearly constant
throughout this phase while the UV$ - $optical colors clearly decline during
the same period, suggesting a decline in the effective temperature.

\citet{Benetti04} interpret these competing effects as the result of
significant \ion{Si}{II} mixing in the ejecta of SN\,2002bo. Mixing or
producing Si in the outermost layers of the ejecta would (i) lead to larger
\ion{Si}{II} velocities, (ii) produce \ion{Si}{II} line ratios that indicate
cool temperatures (because there is less radioactive material to heat the
ejecta), before eventually (iii) producing low values of
$\mathcal{R}($\ion{Si}{II}$)$ as the photosphere recedes through the ejecta to
higher temperature regions. If this interpretation is correct, this is the
likely explanation for the line ratio evolution seen in \sn. \todo{Does TARDIS
tell us anything about this? I have no idea...} \abi{Any chance this could
somehow be related to burning He to Si in the shell?} \fromkate{Devil's
advocate on this: if the idea is that the outer layers are cooler and the
photosphere recedes then there's no reason why we wouldn't see this effect in
all SNe Ia since all of their velocities decrease with time? }

\kate{do you want to say anything about \ion{Ca}{II}?}


In Figure~\ref{fig:spec_comp} we compare the spectral evolution of \sn\ to
SN\,2002bo and iPTF\,10ygu (both \citet{Branch06} Broad Line SNe like \sn).
The evolution of \sn\ and SN\,2002bo is remarkably similar at all phases. The
only significant difference between the two is the absorption trough at
$\sim$4800\,\AA\ in pre- and maximum-light spectra. This feature, which is
typically attributed to a combination of \ion{Fe}{II}, \ion{Fe}{III}, and
\ion{Si}{II}, is extremely narrow in \sn. We believe this is due to a lack of
Fe absorption as the spectra at this epoch show little evidence for iron group
elements (IGEs). iPTF\,10ygu, which exhibits large \ion{Si}{II} velocities
like \sn, shows weaker IME absorption and stronger IGE absorption than \sn.

    \caption{Spectral comparison of \sn\ to \citet{Branch06} Broad Line and
    Cool SNe\,Ia. \textit{Left panel}: pre-maximum spectra showing the
    similarity of \sn\ and SN\,2002bo. While the expansion velocities in the
    Cool SN\,1986G spectrum are considerably lower than those in the Broad
    Line SNe, the relative ratios of the \ion{Si}{II} features are similar.
    \textit{Second panel}: Comparison of \sn\ to the Broad Line SNe\,2002bo
    and PTF\,10ygu. These SNe all feature nearly identical maximum-light
    spectra. By this phase, the relative strength of the \ion{Si}{II}
    absorption features is no longer similar to \citet{Branch06} Cool SNe, as
    illustrated by SN\,2004eo. \textit{Third panel}: $\sim$1 week post-maximum
    spectra. \textit{Fourth panel}: Transitional phase spectra. Comparison
    spectra have been downloaded from WISeREP \citep{Yaron12}, with spectra
    for individual SNe from the following sources: SN\,1986G --
    \citet{Cristiani92}, SN\,2002bo -- \citet{Benetti04,Silverman11},
    PTF\,10ygu -- \citet{Maguire14}, SN\,2004eo -- \citet{Pastorello07}.}

\end{figure*}

The left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:spec_comp} also shows the spectrum of
SN\,1986G, a \citet{Branch06} Cool SN that is sometimes referred to as
``transitional'' given its intermediate properties between normal SNe\,Ia and
the sub-luminous SN\,1991bg-like population (e.g., \citealt{Pastorello07}).
The \ion{Si}{II} line ratios, and narrow $\sim$4800\,\AA\ feature in SN\,1986G
are similar to \sn, confirming the cool nature of the photosphere at this
early epoch. The $-12.0$\,d spectrum of \sn\ additionally shows a weaker blue
line in the \ion{S}{II} ``W'' absorption feature at $\sim$5400\,\AA, which is
also consistent with cool temperatures \citep{Nugent95}. \todo{86G had E(B-V)
~ 0.9, correct spectra for that?}

The maximum-light spectra shown in the second panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:spec_comp} reveal much higher temperatures for \sn, as the
\ion{Si}{II} $\lambda$5972\,\AA\ absorption has nearly disappeared by this
epoch. The appearance of \sn, SN\,2002bo, and iPTF\,10ygu are all similar at
this epoch, with the exception of the 4800\,\AA\ feature mentioned above. We
also show a maximum light spectrum of the \citet{Branch06} Cool, transitional
SN\,2004eo \citep{Pastorello07}. SN\,2004eo has a similar appearance to \sn,
though the lower velocities and cooler temperatures (as traced by both
\ion{Si}{II} $\lambda$5972\,\AA\ and \ion{S}{II}) more clearly reveal the IGE
absorption around 4800\,\AA. \todo{anythingto say about differences at
$\sim$4000\,\AA?}

The third panel of Figure~\ref{fig:spec_comp} shows spectra obtained roughly a
week after maximum light. By this phase absorption due to IGE in \sn\ is
clear. Additional differences between \sn\ and SN\,2002bo can be seen at this
phase. There is stronger absorption in \sn\ blueward of \ion{Ca}{II} H\&K, and
the \ion{S}{II} ``W'' absorption feature is still present in \sn\ and it
cannot be identified in SN\,2002bo or iPTF\,10ygu. SN\,2004eo maintains an
appearance that is somewhat similar to \sn, though as before, the temperatures
are cooler and the velocities lower.

Spectra obtained $\sim$6 weeks after maximum light are shown in the fourth
panel of Figure~\ref{fig:spec_comp}. At this phase, as the SNe are
transitioning into a nebular appearance, the appearance of each spectrum is
similar modulo some minor differences in the relative line strengths of
different features. \todo{add more discussion here? - I don't know a ton about
this phase of evolution}
