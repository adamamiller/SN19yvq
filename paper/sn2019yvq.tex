%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is 
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.3 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.3 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

\section{Discovery and Observations}\label{sec:obs}

\sn\ was discovered by K.~Itagaki, and detected at an unfiltered magnitude of
16.7\,mag, in an image obtained on 2019 Dec 28.74 UT\footnote{UT times are
used throughout this paper}. The transient candidate was announced
$\sim$2\,hr later on the Transient Name Server (TNS), and given the
designation AT\,2019yvq \citep{Itagaki19}. Susequent spectroscopic
observations confirmed the SN nature of the transient, with initial reports
that the event was a SN Ib/c \citep{Kawabata20}, but later reports classified
the event as a SN Ia \todo{create refs for Prentice obs}. These spectroscopic
observations also showed \sn\ to be at the same redshift as NGC\,4441, its
host galaxy.

\subsection{ZTF Photometric Observations}

ZTF simulataneously conducts multiple time-domain surveys using the ZTF
camera on the the Palomar Oschin Schmidt 48 inch (P48) telescope. \sn\ was
first detected by ZTF on 2019 Dec 29.46, as part of the ZTF public survey
(see \citealt{Bellm19a}). The automated ZTF pipeline \citep{Masci19}
automatically detected \sn, which passed internal thresholds (e.g.,
\citealt{Mahabal19}), leading to the production and disemination of a
real-time alert \citep{Patterson19}. The public alert included the position,
$\alpha = 12^{\mathrm{h}}27\arcmin21\farcs836$, $\delta =
+64\degr47\arcmin59\farcs87$ (J2000), and brightness, \rztf$ =
17.14\pm0.05$\,mag, which, together with the \citet{Itagaki19} discovery
report suggested the SN was fading. Continued monitoring with ZTF, and
follow-up with other telescopes, confirmed a spectacular decline in the early
emission from \sn\ (Figure~\ref{fig:p48}).

\end{figure}

The field of \sn\ was additionally observed by ZTF with nearly a nightly
cadence as part of the ZTF partnership Uniform Depth Survey (ZUDS;
D.~Goldstein et al., in prep.). Using images obtained as part of the ZUDS
program, we perform forced PSF photometry at the location of \sn\ following
the procedure described in \citet{Yao19}.\footnote{Images obtained as part of
the ZTF public survey have not been released, preventing us from applying our
forced-PSF measurements. We therefore only include forced-PSF measurements in
the analysis described herein, though we note that our measurements are
largely consistent with those provided in the public alerts.} The evolution
of \sn\ in the \gztf, \rztf, and \iztf\ filters is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:p48}.

\subsection{Other Photometric Observations}

Ultraviolet (UV) observations of \sn\ were obtained with the
Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT; \citet{Roming05}) onboard the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory (hereafter \textit{Swift}; \citealt{Gehrels04})
following a time-of-opportunity request by D.~Hiramatsu. For clarity, we only
show the \textit{Swift} $u$ and $uvw2$ light curves in Figure~\ref{fig:p48}.
\textit{Swift}/UVOT observations show that the initial decline seen in the
optical is even more dramatic in the UV.

We use a second-order polynomial to model the UVOT $b$-band light curve near
peak (including observations between JD$> 2,458,855.5$ and JD$<
2,458,871.5$). From the fit we estimate the time of $B$-band maximum \tbmax$
= 2,458,863.83 \pm 0.21$\,JD and that \sn\ peaked at $B = 14.98 \pm
0.03$\,mag (this estimate has not been corrected for extinction).

\subsection{Optical Spectroscopy}

Spectroscopic observations of \sn\ were taken with a variety of telescopes
and instruments over multiple epochs beginning $\sim$3\,d after discovery and
continuing through $\sim$3\,wk after \tbmax \todo{update these numbers}. An
observing log is listed in Table~\ref{tab:spectra}. The spectra were reduced
using standard procedures in \texttt{IDL}/\texttt{Python}/\texttt{Matlab}.
The optical spectral evolution of \sn\ is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:spec_evo}.

    spectra. Prominent spectral features from intermediate mass elements are
    highlighted with vertical dashed lines. Some of the spectra feature

\section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

\subsection{NGC\,4441: the Host of \sn}

NGC\,4441 is the host galaxy of \sn. SDSS spectroscopic measurements of the
nucleus of NGC\,4441 yield a heliocentric-recession velocity of 2663\,\kms\
($z_\mathrm{helio} = 0.00888$; \citealt{Abolfathi18}) and a
\texttt{STARBURST} classification for NGC\,4441. Using the 2M++ model of
\citet{Carrick15}, we estimate a peculiar velocity towards NGC\,4441 of
$+328.6$\,\kms, which combined with the recession velocity in the frame of
the cosmic microwave background\footnote{See
\url{https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/velocity_calculator}} (CMB, $v_\mathrm{CMB}
= 2770$\,\kms), yields a total recession velocity $\approx 3100$\,\kms. We
note that this estimate is consistent, to within $\sim$5\%, with the Virgo
and Great Attractor infall models of \citet{Mould00}. Adopting $H_0 =
73$\,\kms\,Mpc$^{-1}$, we estimate the distance to NGC\,4441 to be 42.5\,Mpc,
corresponding to a distance modulus of $\mu = 33.14 \pm 0.15$\,mag, where the
uncertainty on $\mu$ is dominated by the uncertainty in the peculiar velocity
correction. We hereafter adopt 33.14\,mag as the distance modulus to
NGC\,4441.\footnote{\citet{Tonry01} estimate a significantly smaller distance
to NGC\,4441 ($\mu = 31.40 \pm 0.45$\,mag; $D = 19.0$\,Mpc) based on surface
brightness fluctuations (SBF). We do not adopt this estimate as SBF
measurements are better suited to relative distance measurements.}


We estimate the total redenning towards \sn\ to be small. There is relatively
little line of sight extinction due to the Milky Way, $E(B-V) \approx
0.018$\,mag \citep{Schlafly11}. Furthermore, we do not find significant
evidence for strong extinction in NGC\,4441. Figure~\ref{fig:NaD} highlights
the \ion{Na}{I} D absorption in the spectrum of \sn\ due to gas in NGC\,4441
and the Milky Way from our highest-resolution spectrum, obtained with the
1000 lines/mm grating on Binospec+MMT. The \ion{Na}{I} D absorption is weak,
and we estimate a total equivalent width (EW) $= 390$\,m\AA\ for NGC\,4441
and $220$\,m\AA\ for the Milky Way. There is a systematic uncertainty of
$\sim$10\% on each of these estimates due to uncertainties in the
continuum-fitting procedure. Assuming similar properties for the dust in
NGC\,4441 and the Milky Way, we scale the color excess measurement for the
Milky Way by the ratio \ion{Na}{I} D EWs to estimate $E(B-V) \approx
0.032$\,mag for \sn\ due to absorption in NGC\,4441. This yields a total
color excess towards \sn\ of $E(B-V) \approx 0.05$\,mag, which we adopt for
the subsequent analysis in this study. We note that this estimate is
consistent, to within the uncertainties, with the EW(\ion{Na}{I} D)--$E(B-V)$
relations presented in \citet{Poznanski12}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3.5in]{./figures/NaD.pdf}

    \caption{Zoom-in on our moderate resolution MMT+Binospec spectrum of \sn\
    highlighting absoprtion due to \ion{Na}{I} D in the host galaxy,
    NGC\,4441 (blue solid line), and the Milky Way (thin black line). The
    velocity scale is centered on the D$_2$ line in NGC\,4441, with the SDSS
    redshift shown via the vertical dashed line. No shift has been applied to
    the Milky Way lines. The \ion{Na}{I} D lines, which serve as a proxy for
    dust-obscuration along the line of sight (e.g.,
    \citep{Poznanski12,Phillips13}) are weak, indicating a relatively small
    amount of reddening. }
    %
    \label{fig:NaD}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Photometric Analysis}

We estimate the time of first light, \tfl, for \sn\ following the procedure
described in \citet{Miller20}. Briefly, \citet{Miller20} model the early
emission from a SN Ia as a power-law in time, $f \propto (t -
t_\mathrm{fl})^\alpha$, where $f$ is the flux, $t$ is time, and $\alpha$ is
the power-law index. \tfl\ is assumed to be the same everywhere in the
optical, allowing us to simultaneously fit observations in each of the ZTF
filters.

An important caveat for \sn\ is that the observed early decline in the light
curve clearly does not follow the simple power-law model, and thus these
observations must be masked when performing the fit. We conservatively
exclude observations from the first two nights of ZTF detection from the fit
(this choice is conservative as it is unclear when the mechanism that powers
the initial bump in \sn\ no longer significantly contributes to the flux in
the \gztf\ and \rztf\ filters). From the fit we find \tfl$ = -17.5
\pm^{1.0}{1.3}$\,d relative to \tbmax (we know \tfl$ < 17.4$\,d based on the
discovery detection in \citealt{Itagaki19} meaning a portion of the posterior
distribution for our model cannot be correct). We also find $\alpha_g = 2.15
\pm^{0.49}{0.36}$ and $\alpha_g = 1.91 \pm^{0.42}{0.31}$. These values are
typical of the normal SNe Ia studied in \citet{Miller20}. If we only exclude
the first observation from the model fit we find significantly different
results with a rise time that increases by $\sim$5\,d and power-law indicies
that increase by $\gtrsim$1.
