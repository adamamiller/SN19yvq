\tablecomments{If a model replicates a specific property we show a \cmark,
whereas properties that are not matched are signified with a \xmark. Ambiguous
cases are shown as \textbf{?}. An important distinction for the companion
interaction and \radni\ clump models is that they are empirical, whereas the
double detonation and violent merger models are based on a specific realization
of an exploding WD. Given that the companion interaction and \radni\ clump
models do not model the explosion itself, we label all properties that are not
generic to the class as \textbf{?}. While the double detonation and \radni\
clump models produce a UV flash, it is unclear whether or not they can match
the magnitude of the observed flash in \sn. The violent merger model does not
track circumstellar material, additional simulations are needed to understand
whether interaction between the ejecta and unbound material could reproduce the
UV flash (see text). In addition to showing evidence for IGE absorption in the
early spectra, the double detonation and \radni\ clump models show strong IGE
absorption and line blanketing around maximum light that is not observed in
\sn.}
